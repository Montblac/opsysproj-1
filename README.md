# Project 1: Process and Resource Management
The first project for class CS143B at UC Irvine. The program emulates the part of the kernel that manages processes and resources. Basic operations such as the creation and deletion of processes will be included as well as requesting resources, releasing resources, blocking, and hardware interruptions.
